//! hai-core - Core library for Home Assistant Installer
//!
//! This library provides the shared business logic for the Home Assistant
//! Installer, including device enumeration, image downloading, disk writing,
//! and VM provisioning for Proxmox and UTM.
//!
//! The library is designed to be frontend-agnostic, supporting both the
//! Tauri desktop application and potential TUI implementations.

/// This trait abstracts the progress reporting mechanism, allowing hai-core
/// to work with different frontends (Tauri desktop, TUI, etc.) without
/// coupling to any specific implementation.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use hai_core::{FlashProgress, ProgressCallback};
///
/// struct MyProgressHandler;
///
/// impl ProgressCallback for MyProgressHandler {
///     fn on_progress(&self, progress: FlashProgress) {
///         println!("Progress: {}%", progress.progress);
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    /// during long-running operations like downloads and disk writes.
