## Workspace Restructuring

**Goal:** Restructure HAI into a Cargo workspace with shared core logic to enable future TUI support and better code organization.

### Motivation

The current monolithic Tauri app structure makes it difficult to:
- Share business logic with other frontends (CLI, TUI)
- Test core logic independently
- Build a minimal live USB installer for mini PCs

By extracting core logic into a shared library (`hai-core`), we enable:
- **Code reuse** across desktop and future TUI installers
- **Better testing** with isolated core logic
- **Minimal live USB** (~100MB) for mini PC installations
- **Consistent behavior** across all installation methods

### Phase W1: Workspace Infrastructure

**Goal:** Create Cargo workspace and move existing code.

#### Workspace Setup

- [x] Create root `Cargo.toml` with workspace configuration
- [x] Create `crates/` directory structure
- [x] Move `src-tauri/` to `crates/hai-desktop/`
- [x] ~~Create `src-tauri` symlink to `crates/hai-desktop` for Tauri CLI compatibility~~ (removed: cargo fails to resolve the symlinked path into the workspace on Windows; the Tauri CLI discovers `crates/hai-desktop/tauri.conf.json` on its own)
- [x] Update `tauri.conf.json` paths (frontendDist, beforeBuildCommand cwd)
- [x] Frontend remains at project root (simpler than moving to nested folder)

#### Verification

- [x] Extract Proxmox types (`ProxmoxCredentials`, `ProxmoxSession`, etc.)
- [x] Extract UTM types (`UtmConfig`, `UtmVm`, `UtmVmStatus`)

#### Error Handling

- [x] Create unified `Error` enum with `thiserror`
- [x] Add error variants for network, IO, device, permission errors

#### Verification

- [x] All types compile in hai-core
- [x] hai-desktop can import types from hai-core

---

### Phase W3: Extract hai-core - Device Enumeration

**Goal:** Extract block device enumeration to hai-core.

#### Device Module

- [x] Move macOS device enumeration (diskutil/plist parsing)
- [x] Move Linux device enumeration (lsblk/JSON parsing)
- [x] Move Windows device enumeration (PowerShell)
- [x] Add `list_devices()` public function

#### Verification

- [x] Device enumeration works on macOS

- [x] Move Linux disk writer (direct write)
- [x] Move Windows disk writer (PowerShell)
- [x] Move safety validations (system drive protection)
- [x] Move unmount/eject logic
- [x] Move verification logic
- [x] Use progress callback trait with channel-based updates from blocking tasks
- [x] Progress updates every 10MB for write and verify stages

#### Verification

- [x] Mock flash works with progress
- [x] Real flash works (manual test)

---

### Phase W6: Extract hai-core - Proxmox Module

**Goal:** Extract Proxmox API integration to hai-core.

#### Proxmox Module

- [x] Move authentication logic
- [x] Move node listing
- [x] Move storage listing
- [x] Move VM creation with progress callback
- [x] Image upload with progress (via commands.rs using download module)
- [x] Mock mode support with simulated progress
- [ ] Move task waiting (real implementation)
- [ ] Move IP detection (real implementation)

#### Verification

- [x] Proxmox flow works end-to-end (mock mode)

---

### Phase W7: Extract hai-core - UTM Module

**Goal:** Extract UTM automation to hai-core.

#### UTM Module

- [x] Move UTM detection (check_utm_status via Info.plist)
- [x] Move VM creation with AppleScript automation
- [x] Mock mode support with simulated progress
- [x] Platform-conditional compilation (macOS only)
- [ ] Move VM start/stop/delete commands
- [ ] Move status and IP detection

#### Verification

- [x] UTM flow works end-to-end (requires macOS with UTM)

---

### Phase W8: Update hai-desktop Commands

**Goal:** Convert hai-desktop commands to thin wrappers.

#### Command Wrappers

- [x] Create `TauriProgressCallback` implementing `ProgressCallback` trait
- [x] Update `list_block_devices` command (uses hai_core::devices)
- [x] Update `flash_image` command (uses hai_core::download and hai_core::disk_writer)
- [x] Update all Proxmox commands (uses hai_core::proxmox)
- [x] Update all UTM commands (uses hai_core::utm)
- [x] Update network check commands (check_ha_ready, check_ha_updated)
- [x] Update release/manifest commands (uses hai_core::download)

#### Verification

- [x] All existing functionality works
- [x] E2E tests pass
- [x] Mock mode works

---

### Phase W9: Future - hai-tui (Deferred)

**Goal:** Create terminal UI application for live USB.

This phase is deferred to a later milestone. The workspace structure is prepared for future addition:

```
crates/
├── hai-core/       # ✓ Shared library
├── hai-desktop/    # ✓ Tauri app
└── hai-tui/        # Future: Terminal UI
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src/
        ├── main.rs
        ├── app.rs      # State machine
        ├── ui.rs       # Ratatui rendering
        └── screens/    # Screen implementations
```

Features for hai-tui:
- Ratatui-based terminal UI
- Same core logic as hai-desktop
- Minimal dependencies for small binary
- Static musl build for live USB
